<p> Harry Potter and The Hunger Games changed the face of YA fiction, but where does Harry Potter reign supreme, or how is THG better than the boy wizard?
Harry Potter and The Hunger Games were each successful as books and movies. Their stories reached wide audiences with their magical fantasy charm or 
future dystopian intrigue. As different as the two franchises could be, some things were similar about them. Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen each 
had to go on a journey of no return. The events of their lives would shape who they would become as they got older. Each series had moments of 
light and darkness, but while they shared things in common, each series had events or storylines that were handled better than the other. </p>
