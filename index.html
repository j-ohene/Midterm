                  Harry Potter and The Hunger Games changed the face of YA fiction,

                     were each successful as  books and movies. Their stories reached wide audiences with their magical 
                     fantasy charm or future dystopian intrigue. As different as the two franchises could be, some things 
                     were similar about them. Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen each had to go on a journey of no return. 
                     The events of their lives would shape who they would become as they got older. Each series had moments of 
                     light and darkness,but while they shared things in common, each series had events or storylines that were 
                     handled better than the other.

                     By the time Harry attends Hogwarts or Katniss volunteers for the Hunger Games, 
                     there have been notable events in each world that have been building to a war. 
                     In the wizarding world, everyone is happy that Voldemort is dead, and his followers have 
                     been thrown in Azkaban or have been hiding amongst society. 
                     <br><br>
                     Still, Dumbledore knows it is only a matter of time before Voldemort returns. 
                     Yet, it is a known fact that Voldemort is not the first dark wizard to attempt domination. 
                     Previously, Gellert Grindelwald had tried to do the same thing. There is a history embedded 
                     in the series.

                     Katniss Everdeen is never meant to be "The Chosen One." 
                     Unlike Harry Potter, that fate is not affiliated with her identity 
                     when she was a baby. Instead, it was Katniss's actions that caused 
                     people to follow her. By standing with Rue and <u>Peeta</u>, Katniss gained 
                     love from the districts and fans of the Games.
                     <br><br>
                     The Mockingjay became a symbol of hope for the rebellion. 
                     When the uprising tries to feed Katniss lines of dialogue for Propos, 
                     it does not sit right. However, when <u>Katniss speaks</u> and acts without being 
                     told what to do, she becomes a leader that people respect and follow.</p>
               <h2> Why the Hunger Games has aged so well</h2>
                  
            <p>The Hunger Games proves to be an amazing series with a vast variety of themes such as the commentary on capitalism brutality and
                   the futility of war. Everything about the series is incredibly allegorical. This tends to be overlooked in favour of the romance and love 
                   triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. In Panem wealth is heavily concentrated to the most wealthy specifically the people living in the capitol. 
                   This causes massive disparity between their lives and the poorer districts in many ways such as food security. To richer people living in the capitol,
                    the games are a reality show and the tributes have become commodities. For 75 years, the children drafted, have had their value as people reduced to objects 
                    of entertainment. Katniss’ alleged pregnancy in the second book forced the citizens to become more critical and re-evaluate the ethics behind the games. This disrupted 
                    the status quo making people to realized they can no longer be complicit to this objectification as means of public control. 
                  The series proves to be incredible many years later due to the endless ways it can be analyzed and how well it has aged.

                  <h2> Parallels of War</h2>
                  <p> Harry never wanted to become the “chosen one” he was destined to have the role. One thing the Harry Potter series handled well, was that Harry not only had to train 
                     to be strong enough to protect himself, he had to fight for the respect of others as a leader. Another thing that was well written was the friendships and relationships 
                     between the main characters. It is constantly emphasized how important their friendships were to get through his journey to defeat Voldemort. The political corruption in 
                     the beginning was a lot more subtle and only became more apparent as the series went on. The final battle was not just Harry vs Voldemort it showed Hermione, Ron, Neville, 
                     and several others doing their part to kill Death Eaters. Regardless of the films portrayal of the war or the novel, the war had way more build-up to the war than The Hunger Games did
