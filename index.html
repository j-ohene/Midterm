        <h2> Why The Hunger Games Themes Remain Relevent</h2>
        <p>The Hunger Games proves to be an amazing series with a vast variety of themes such as the commentary on capitalism brutality and the futility of war. Everything about the series is incredibly allegorical.
             This tends to be overlooked in favour of the romance and love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. In Panem wealth is heavily concentrated to the most wealthy specifically the people living in the capitol. This 
             causes massive disparity between their lives and the poorer districts in many ways such as food security. To richer people living in the capitol, the games are a reality show and the tributes have become commodities. For 75 years, 
             the children drafted, have had their value as people reduced 
             to objects of entertainment. Katnissâ€™ alleged pregnancy in the second book forced the citizens to become more critical and re-evaluate the ethics behind the games. This disrupted the status quo making people to realized they can no longer be complicit to this objectification as means of 
             public control. The series proves to be incredible many years later due to the endless ways it can be analyzed and how well it has aged.</p>
