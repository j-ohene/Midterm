               Harry Potter and The Hunger Games changed the face of YA fiction, 
               but where does Harry Potter reign supreme, or how is The Hunger Games better than the 
               boy wizard?

                  <i><span style="color: #ae0001;">Harry Potter</span></i> and <i><span style="color: #dd8b26;">The Hunger Games</span></i> 
                  were each successful as  books and movies. Their stories reached wide audiences with their magical 
                  fantasy charm or future dystopian intrigue. As different as the two franchises could be, some things 
                  were similar about them. Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen each had to go on a journey of no return. 
                  The events of their lives would shape who they would become as they got older. Each series had moments of 
                  light and darkness,but while they shared things in common, each series had events or storylines that were 
                  handled better than the other.

                  By the time Harry attends Hogwarts or Katniss volunteers for the Hunger Games, 
                  there have been notable events in each world that have been building to a war. 
                  In the wizarding world, everyone is happy that Voldemort is dead, and his followers have 
                  been thrown in Azkaban or have been hiding amongst society. 
                  <br><br>
                  Still, Dumbledore knows it is only a matter of time before Voldemort returns. 
                  Yet, it is a known fact that Voldemort is not the first dark wizard to attempt domination. 
                  Previously, Gellert Grindelwald had tried to do the same thing. There is a history embedded 
                  in the series.
