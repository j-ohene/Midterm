                     were similar about them. Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen each had to go on a journey of no return. 
                     The events of their lives would shape who they would become as they got older. Each series had moments of

                     By the time Harry attends Hogwarts or Katniss volunteers for the Hunger Games, 
                     there have been notable events in each world that have been building to a war. 
                     In the wizarding world, everyone is happy that Voldemort is dead, and his followers have 
                     been thrown in Azkaban or have been hiding amongst society. 
                     <br><br>
                     Still, Dumbledore knows it is only a matter of time before Voldemort returns. 
                     Yet, it is a known fact that Voldemort is not the first dark wizard to attempt domination. 
                     Previously, Gellert Grindelwald had tried to do the same thing. There is a history embedded 
                     in the series.

                     Dark Lord. However, even before knowing the truth about his fate, Harry had always been a 
                     leader.
                     <br><br>
                     Still, because Voldemort was obsessed with killing Harry, Harry gained far more defense

                     others were willing to follow him. However, people were not just fighting for Harry. 
                     It was always far more significant than him.

                        <i>The Harry Potter</i> franchise understands the power of friendship and utilizes it 
                        throughout the series. No matter which installment, <u>Harry's relationships with Ron

                        and the love that comes with it, is one of the most central aspects of the series.

                        Both franchises have excellent examples of a <u>corrupt government</u>. However, what makes 
                        the wizarding world have a better portrayal of a corrupt government is how it begins 
                        as slightly corrupt and then slowly becomes worse.
                        <br><br>
                        Minister Fudge is not an ideal leader, choosing to blatantly ignore any possibility of 
                        Voldemort's return and instead turn the narrative against Harry and <u>Dumbledore</u>, 
                        claiming they are liars. Ministry employee Dolores Umbridge works at Hogwarts for a year 
                        and is continually spying on the students. As Voldemort begins making broader moves, he 
                        gains control of the Ministry, turning the wizarding world against Harry, painting him as 
                        Undesirable Number One.

                        It was only a matter of time before Harry and Voldemort faced 
                        each other in one final battle. Harry spends months searching 
                        for Voldemort's Horcruxes to prevent him from latching onto life. 
                        Voldemort can only be killed after his Horcruxes are all destroyed.

                        The final battle is not just Harry against Voldemort, though.

                        others playing their part to kill Death Eaters. Regardless of 
                        the film portrayal of the war or the novel, everything about 
                        the war had far more build-up than the war in

                     Unlike Harry Potter, that fate is not affiliated with her identity 
                     when she was a baby. Instead, it was Katniss's actions that caused 
                     people to follow her. By standing with Rue and <u>Peeta</u>, Katniss gained 
                     love from the districts and fans of the Games.

                     The Mockingjay became a symbol of hope for the rebellion.

                     told what to do, she becomes a leader that people respect and follow.

                     <br><br>
                     Due to the Capitol letting the other districts believe that District Thirteen had been
