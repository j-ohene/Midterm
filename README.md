 Harry Potter and The Hunger Games changed the face of YA fiction, but where does Harry Potter reign supreme, or how is THG better than the boy wizard?
 <i>Harry Potter and The Hunger Games</i> were each successful as books and movies. Their stories reached wide audiences with their magical fantasy charm or future dystopian intrigue. As different as the two franchises could be, some things were similar about them. Harry Potter and Katniss Everdeen each had to go on a journey of no return.
