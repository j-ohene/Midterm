It is very difficult to judge which series is better as they are far diffrent in nature. The Harry Potter series is much longer, with the actors in the film growing up while shooting the film. While the Hunger Games is 4 films centered in a shorter amount of time. If the Hunger Games had 7 books and 8 movies, would it have been better?

Our website explains that the Hunger Games may not be so diffrent then the Harry Potter series. We compaired those similarities trying to determine who did it better.
